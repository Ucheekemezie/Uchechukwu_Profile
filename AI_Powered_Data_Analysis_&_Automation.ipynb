        "- Marketing_Spend is positively correlated with higher sales, confirming that promotional investments drive revenue.\n",
        "- Seasonality plays a key role in sales volume, with some periods (e.g., holidays or dry season) yielding significantly more sales.\n",
        "- Credit_Score and Loan_Amount are the strongest indicators of loan default risk.\n",
        "- Median imputation was successful in maintaining model integrity, with no major drop in performance due to missing data.\n",
        "- Customers with mid-range incomes and average credit scores typically fall into the low-risk segment for loan approvals.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 6. Recommendations\n",
        "**Sales Strategy**\n",
        "- Increase marketing spend during high-performing seasonal windows to maximize ROI.\n",
        "- Monitor **Seasonality** impact continuously and use time-aware forecasting for future planning.\n",

        "**Loan Approval Policy**\n",
        "- Use the trained classification model to screen applicants with high loan amounts and low credit scores.\n",

The results confirm that marketing effectiveness and customer creditworthiness can be predicted and optimized with well-prepared data and machine learning. The sales forecasting and risk classification models provide a strong foundation for more advanced analytics and automation."
